# Introduction

  Education is an important element of the society, every government and country in the world work so hard to improve this sector. With the corona-virus outbreak that has disrupted life around the globe in 2020, the educational systems have been affected in many ways; studies show that studentâ€™s performance has decreased since then, which highlights the need to deal with this problem more seriously and try to find effective solutions, as well as the influencing factors.  

# Motivation

  The educational systems need, at this specific time, innovative ways to improve quality of education to achieve the best results and decrease the failure rate. 
  
  As students of the IT department who studied in the last month a little about machine learning, we know that in order for an institute to provide quality education to learners, deep analysis of previous records of the learners can play a vital role, and wanted to work on this challenging task.
